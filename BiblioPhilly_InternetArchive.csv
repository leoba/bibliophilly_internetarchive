A collection of excerpts from various medical texts available to a sixteenth-century physician. This particular manuscript was probably organized and commissioned by an Italian physician. The book was never finished, as some of the pages have line drawings for illuminations that were never colored in. Of note in this book is the Venereal Man featured in a selection from De Apostematibus by Bertapalia. This specific section of the text refers to medical issues such as scrofulis ruptis (ruptured scrotum). It is unclear what Venereal Man's medical issue is precisely, however, he appears to have been circumcised, an uncommon practice in sixteenth-century Italy.","Damage","Miscellany","16th century","Medical-pharmaceutical miscellany","Historical Medical Library of The College of Physicians of Philadelphia","1500","upenn","lat","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/","Public Domain","Upenn Code (need to get)","Digitized through the Bibliotheca Philadelphiensis project.

"lewis_e_053","lewis_e_053.pdf","Free Library of Philadelphia, Lewis E 53. Italy, 1250-1280. This mid-thirteenth-century manuscript, produced in Italy, contains a collection of commentaries on works by Aristotle (384 BC-322 BC), most of which are anonymous. However, the commentaries on a pseudo-Aristotelian work on plants, on Aristotle's On Sense and the Sensible, and on the On Generation and Corruption, which are included in the manuscript, have been identified as works by Adam of Buckfield, a professor at Oxford during the thirteenth century. Sewn into the back of the manuscript is a printed bifolium on parchment of 1576 that contains an abbreviated Italian biography of Francis Petrarch (1304-1374). This post-medieval addition to the book is partly responsible for the book being misidentified as having once been part of Petrarch's library. Catalog entries and a note written in the hand of John Frederick Lewis further identify this book as stemming from Petrarch's library, which had been gifted to the Venetian Republic in 1362. In 1635, an unknown person added bookplates to books falsely believed to be from Petrarch's library as evidence of their provenance. It is not clear how this manuscript acquired the bookplate, but it now certain that it was not among Petrarch's library collection. The print that was pasted into the inside of the cover is an engraving by Hans Vredeman de Vries (1527-ca. 1607), a Dutch Renaissance architect and engineer.","13th century","Italian","Italy","Biography of Petrarch; Glosse de libris meteororum (Gloss on the Book of Meteors); Glosse de libris meteororum IV (Gloss on the Book of Meteors IV)","Free Library of Philadelphia","1250","upenn","lat","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/","Public Domain","Upenn Code (need to get)","Digitized through the Bibliotheca Philadelphiensis project.

The miniature of David and Bathsheba (fol. 96r), which introduces the Penitential Psalms, includes a landscape view of the famous castle of Mehun-sur-YÃ¨vre, made famous by Jean, Duc de Berry. Pages containing the miniature for the Hours of the Holy Spirit and the miniature for the Suffrage to Saint Margaret are missing. The miniatures are by an unidentified artist likely active in Bourges, and associated with Jacquelin de MontluÃ§on, the Master of the Moneypenny Breviary, and the Master of Spencer 6. The verso of the final folio (fol. 153v) contains an elaborate heraldic achievement, likely dating from soon after the production of the manuscript, with arms (azure, a fleur-de-lys or, party per pale azure, an eagle gules) that have been attributed, probably incorrectly, to the Haland de Saint Hermine de Vattier family.","16th century","French","France","Book of Hours, use of Bourges","Free Library of Philadelphia","1495","upenn","lat","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/","Public Domain","Upenn Code (need to get)","Digitized through the Bibliotheca Philadelphiensis project.

This Book of Hours of the Use of Rome is written in a Rotunda script unusual for manuscripts produced in Northern France. It contains a calendar with arched border vignettes of the labors of the month and the zodiac. The Gospel Lessons, each of which is illustrated by a small miniature, are followed directly by the Obsecro te and O intemerata prayers, also accompanied by small miniatures. The Hours of the Virgin opens with a miniature of the Annunciation with four border vignettes, and each subsequent hour is illustrated with a larre miniature surrounded by an inhabited border, though the miniature or Prime is missing. The Hours of the Cross (miniature lacking) and Hours of the Holy Spirit follow. The Penitential Psalms, Litany, and Prayers are followed by the Office of the Dead. The penultimate section consists of suffrages to Saints Michael, John the Baptist, Sebastian, Christopher, Anthony, Nicholas, Catherine, Barbara, and Margaret. The final section, its decoration unfinished, consists of a Mass of the Virgin written in a distinct Rotunda script with Northern elements. The twenty-four calendar vignettes and all of the small miniatures except for one are by an artist perhaps from Tours, while the eleven large miniatures and the small miniature of the Virgin and Child on fol. 22r are by a more conventional artist likely trained in Paris.

"mss_0095_031","mss_0095_031.pdf","University of Delaware Library, MSS 95, Item 31. Amiens?, France, Written in Northern France, possibly Amiens; circa 1480-1500. This Book of Hours of the use of Noyon, produced at the end of the fifteenth century, contains ten large miniatures, as well as five small inset miniatures and an historiated initial illustrating the Passion of Christ. The style of the illumination suggests that this manuscript was produced in Amiens. The text is for a patron in Picardy, most likely one from Noyon: the Use conforms to those in other books known to be from Noyon, and the Litany includes Saint MÃ©dard (fol. 77r), who translated his see to Noyon from Vermand in 531. The book begins with a series of unnumbered flyleaves integral to the book block, which contain an rhyming original ownership inscription in French and a rhyming couplet about health and money, as well as the ownership inscriptions of subsequent seventeenth- and eighteenth-century French owners. The book begins with a calendar, followed by the Gospel Lessons, which are introduced with a miniature of Saint John on Patmos (fol. 16r). The Passion according to Saint John occurs next. It is prefaced with a large miniature of the Agony in the Garden (fol. 21r), and is punctuated by smaller miniatures showing: Christ with Apostles and Soldiers (fol. 20r); the Arrest of Christ (the unique historiated initial, fol. 23r); Christ before Pilate (fol. 24v); the Flagellation (fol. 25r); and the Crucifixion (fol. 25v). The Obsecro te and O intemerata prayers occur next, prior to the Hours of the Virgin, which is illustrated with miniatures of the Annunciation (fol. 35r); Visitation (fol. 42r); Nativity (fol. 49r); Annunciation to the Shepherds (fol. 52v); Adoration of the Magi (fol. 55r); and Flight into Egypt (fol. 60v). Atypically, there are no miniatures for Nones and Compline, and the text of the Hours of the Virgin runs continuously, without page breaks for the beginning of each Hour. The Penitential Psalms are introduced by a miniature of the penitent King David (fol. 68v) and the Office of the Dead is introduced by a miniature depicting the Raising of Lazarus. The final section of the book, which is unillustrated, is comprised of the Seven Prayers of Saint Gregory followed by two Prayers of Pope Leo, the Seven Joys of the Virgin, a prayer to the Five Feasts of the Virgin, the Stabat Mater, and the O illustrissima et excellentissima... prayer to the Virgin.","15th century","French","France","Book of Hours, Use of Noyon","University of Delaware Library","1480","upenn","lat","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/","Public Domain","Upenn Code (need to get)","Digitized through the Bibliotheca Philadelphiensis project.
